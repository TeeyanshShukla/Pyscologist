# Chat Integration Setup Guide

This document explains how the CLI backend (`chat model.js`) has been successfully bridged with the Next.js frontend.

## What Was Done

### 1. **Extracted Reusable Chat Service** (`lib/chat-service.js`)
- Extracted all AI logic from `chat model.js`
- Functions: `getChatResponse()`, `loadUserMemories()`, `saveMemory()`, `validateUserName()`
- Maintains identical SRK persona and memory management
- Supports both production mode (with API keys) and demo mode

### 2. **Created API Endpoint** (`pyscologist-frontend/app/api/chat/route.ts`)
- RESTful POST endpoint at `/api/chat`
- Accepts: `{message, userId, messageHistory}`
- Returns: `{success, response, messageHistory}`
- Proper error handling and validation

### 3. **Updated Frontend** (`pyscologist-frontend/app/chat/page.tsx`)
- Replaced mock `handleSend()` function with real API calls
- Added error handling and loading states
- Maintained all existing UI components and styling

## How to Use

### For Development (Demo Mode)
The integration works out of the box in demo mode:
```bash
cd pyscologist-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Visit `http://localhost:3000/chat` and start chatting!

### For Production (With Real AI)
1. Get a Google Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
2. Create `.env.local` in the `pyscologist-frontend` directory:
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```
3. Start Qdrant vector database (for memory):
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Features Maintained
- ✅ **SRK Persona**: Identical personality from CLI version
- ✅ **Memory Management**: Context-aware conversations
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks
- ✅ **User Validation**: Same validation logic
- ✅ **Beautiful UI**: All existing frontend components preserved

## Demo Mode Responses
When no API key is configured, the system uses curated SRK-style responses:
- "Hello my friend! I'm here to listen and support you..."
- "I hear you, and thank you for sharing that with me..."
- "You know, life has taught me that our greatest growth..."
- And more therapeutic, SRK-inspired messages

## Architecture
```
Frontend (Next.js) → API Route (/api/chat) → Chat Service → Gemini AI + Memory
```

The integration is minimal and surgical - only 3 files were modified to bridge the two systems while preserving all functionality.
